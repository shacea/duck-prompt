# GRAPH\_RECURSION\_LIMIT [¬∂](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/troubleshooting/errors/GRAPH_RECURSION_LIMIT/\#graph_recursion_limit "Permanent link")

Your LangGraph [`StateGraph`](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/reference/graphs/#langgraph.graph.state.StateGraph) reached the maximum number of steps before hitting a stop condition.
This is often due to an infinite loop caused by code like the example below:

```md-code__content
class State(TypedDict):
    some_key: str

builder = StateGraph(State)
builder.add_node("a", ...)
builder.add_node("b", ...)
builder.add_edge("a", "b")
builder.add_edge("b", "a")
...

graph = builder.compile()

```

However, complex graphs may hit the default limit naturally.

## Troubleshooting [¬∂](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/troubleshooting/errors/GRAPH_RECURSION_LIMIT/\#troubleshooting "Permanent link")

- If you are not expecting your graph to go through many iterations, you likely have a cycle. Check your logic for infinite loops.
- If you have a complex graph, you can pass in a higher `recursion_limit` value into your `config` object when invoking your graph like this:

```md-code__content
graph.invoke({...}, {"recursion_limit": 100})

```

What is recommended if we have a long running mostly autonomous agent - say it's running for a week and doing multiple tasks a day, each running many nodes and/or node loops? Just pick an arbitrarily large number like 999999999, or something else?

I have a similar question. In my case, the agent is a chat system, which may run an indefinitely long time. Typically, a human will be involved, thus naturally limiting the number of interactions to a finite high number. But an agent might be interacting with other agents, each one continuing their independent conversations with other agents indefinitely. I want to be able to turn off this recursion limit, and take responsibility for detecting non-productive infinite loops myself.
