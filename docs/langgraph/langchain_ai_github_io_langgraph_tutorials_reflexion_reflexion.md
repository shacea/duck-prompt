# Reflexion [¶](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/tutorials/reflexion/reflexion/\#reflexion "Permanent link")

[Reflexion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.11366) by Shinn, et. al., is an architecture designed to learn through verbal feedback and self-reflection. The agent explicitly critiques its responses for tasks to generate a higher quality final response, at the expense of longer execution time.

![reflexion diagram](<Base64-Image-Removed>)

The paper outlines 3 main components:

1. Actor (agent) with self-reflection
2. External evaluator (task-specific, e.g. code compilation steps)
3. Episodic memory that stores the reflections from (1).

In their code, the last two components are very task-specific, so in this notebook, you will build the _actor_ in LangGraph.

To skip to the graph definition, see the [Construct Graph section](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/tutorials/reflexion/reflexion/#Construct-Graph) below.

## Setup [¶](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/tutorials/reflexion/reflexion/\#setup "Permanent link")

Install `langgraph` (for the framework), `langchain_openai` (for the LLM), and `langchain` \+ `tavily-python` (for the search engine).

We will use tavily search as a tool. You can get an API key [here](https://app.tavily.com/sign-in) or replace with a different tool of your choosing.

```md-code__content
%pip install -U --quiet langgraph langchain_anthropic tavily-python

```

```md-code__content
import getpass
import os

def _set_if_undefined(var: str) -> None:
    if os.environ.get(var):
        return
    os.environ[var] = getpass.getpass(var)

_set_if_undefined("ANTHROPIC_API_KEY")

## Actor (with reflection) [¶](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/tutorials/reflexion/reflexion/\#actor-with-reflection "Permanent link")

The main component of Reflexion is the "actor", which is an agent that reflects on its response and re-executes to improve based on self-critique. It's main sub-components include:
1\. Tools/tool execution
2\. Initial responder: generate an initial response (and self-reflection)
3\. Revisor: re-respond (and reflec) based on previous reflections

We'll first define the tool execution context.

Using Pydantic with LangChain

This notebook uses Pydantic v2 `BaseModel`, which requires `langchain-core >= 0.3`. Using `langchain-core < 0.3` will result in errors due to mixing of Pydantic v1 and v2 `BaseModels`.

One recent study by the Rhodium Group found that even if the Biden administration implemented a sweeping package of climate measures \u2014 including hundreds of billions of dollars in clean energy spending that remains stalled in Congress \u2014 and individual states adopted tougher rules of their own, the United States would barely stay on track to meet its target.\n In 2014, before the Paris climate agreement, the world was on track to heat up nearly 4 degrees Celsius (7.2 degrees Fahrenheit) by the end of the century, an outcome widely seen as catastrophic.\n In response, a growing number of world leaders, including President Biden, have said that the world should hold to 1.5 degrees of warming, although some countries like China and India have not embraced the stricter goal.\n In recent years, more than 50 countries plus the European Union have formally vowed to get to \u201cnet zero\u201d emissions, which is essentially a promise to stop adding greenhouse gases to the atmosphere altogether by a certain date."}, {"url": "https://www.worldbank.org/en/news/feature/2023/09/19/climate-policies-with-real-world-results", "content": "\u201cThey provide invaluable insights on how countries actually design and implement climate policies, and on the hard compromises that doing so can require, such as the rapid expansion of solar power in India, the use of waste to generate affordable energy in Mexico, and the greening of Colombia\u2019s construction industry.\u201d\n The plan also expects for the modal share for bikes to grow from 0.9 percent in 2019 to 11.6 percent by 2050 and estimates that the project could reduce emissions in Lima by 0.64 ton of carbon dioxide equivalent (tCO2e) by 2030 and 1.03 tCO2e by 2050.

  Args:\
    answer: Tackling the climate crisis demands a multi-pronged global effort targeting policy reforms, technological innovation, behavior changes, and nature-based solutions. Key policy measures include carbon pricing, emissions regulations, clean energy incentives, and international climate agreements. Major technological breakthroughs are needed in clean energy storage, carbon capture, sustainable fuels, hydrogen and more.\
\
However, formidable challenges persist - entrenched fossil fuel interests resisting change, political gridlock, difficulties transitioning carbon-intensive economies, international free-rider problems, and financing needs for developing countries. Developing nations will require substantial support to participate fully in mitigation efforts.\
\
Nature-based solutions like forest conservation, reforestation and coastal restoration could provide up to 30% of needed emissions reductions by 2050 [1]. They offer significant co-benefits for biodiversity and communities. Individual actions to reduce energy use, favor plant-based diets, drive electric vehicles etc. can also move the needle.\
\
Ultimately, dramatically bending the emissions curve requires a holistic global strategy coordinating all these elements. The costs of inaction risk civilization-threatening impacts from accelerating climate change [2]. Time is of the essence to alter our current trajectory.\

Other countries such as Malawi and Pakistan are modernizing the capture and use of climate data and early warning systems, equipping communities, farmers and policy makers with the information they need to protect lives and livelihoods.\n With every fraction of a degree of warming, the impacts of climate change will become more frequent and more intense \u2013 and adaptation will become that much harder and more expensive for people and ecosystems.\n"}]]\

## Conclusion [¶](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/tutorials/reflexion/reflexion/\#conclusion "Permanent link")\
\
Congrats on building a Reflexion actor! I'll leave you with a few observations to save you some time when choosing which parts of this agent to adapt to your workflow:\
1\. This agent trades off execution time for quality. It explicitly forces the agent to critique and revise the output over several steps, which usually (not always) increases the response quality but takes much longer to return a final answer\
2\. The 'reflections' can be paired with additional external feedback (such as validators), to further guide the actor.\
3\. In the paper, 1 environment (AlfWorld) uses external memory. It does this by storing summaries of the reflections to an external store and using them in subsequent trials/invocations.\

For me the problem persists. In my opinion, the problem lies in the validator:\
\
class ResponderWithRetries:\
\
def **init**(self, runnable, validator):\
\
self.runnable = runnable\
\
self.validator = validator\
\
```notranslate\
def respond(self, state: list):\
    response = []\
    for attempt in range(3):\
        response = self.runnable.invoke(\
            {"messages": state}, {"tags": [f"attempt:{attempt}"]} #<<< that may generate the problem\
        )\
\
```\

In the following class, the `respond` method takes the state variable as a `list` type, but it appears to be treated as a dictionary with expressions like `state["messages"]`. Could you please check this?\

I think this is because the argument \`state' of respond() is of type dict. You can check if you dare to rise ValidationError.\
\

\
`state = state + [`\
- Correct\
\
`state["messages"] = state["messages"] + [`\
