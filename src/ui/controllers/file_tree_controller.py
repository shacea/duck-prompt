# Placeholder for File Tree Controller
# This controller will handle events and logic related to the file tree view (QTreeView)
# and its models (FilteredFileSystemModel, CheckableProxyModel).

# Example responsibilities:
# - Handling context menu actions (rename, delete, new file/folder)
# - Managing drag and drop operations (if implemented)
# - Coordinating updates between the model and the view
# - Interacting with FilesystemService for file operations

class FileTreeController:
    def __init__(self, main_window, file_system_service):
        self.mw = main_window
        self.fs_service = file_system_service
        # TODO: Connect signals from tree view and models

    # --- Placeholder methods ---
    def handle_rename_request(self, index):
        # Get path from index
        # Show input dialog
        # Call fs_service.rename(...)
        # Refresh view
        pass

    def handle_delete_request(self, index):
        # Get path from index
        # Show confirmation dialog
        # Call fs_service.delete(...)
        # Refresh view
        pass

    def handle_selection_change(self, selected, deselected):
        # Logic for toggling check state on click/selection
        # This might involve calling setData on the CheckableProxyModel
        pass

    def refresh_tree_view(self):
        # Logic to refresh the tree view, potentially reloading the model root
        pass

    # ... other methods as needed ...
